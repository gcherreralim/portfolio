                        <span class="port-desc desc1 desc-left" data-scroll>In the modern-day NBA, positions don't define the play styles, skillsets, and tendencies as they did decades ago.
                            Players categorized under these positions, often defined by his place on the court and relative height within the lineup, don't usually play the same way,
                            have the same strengths and weaknesses, and provide the same value for their teams. When it comes to building championship teams and effective lineups, the vagueness
                            of traditional positions causes many failed "superteam" experiments for franchises that stack up on talent but overlook potential chemistry issues and conflicting play
                            styles.<br><br>By using relevant per-100 numbers, advanced statistics, and tendency metrics, we were able to use model-based clustering and random forest models to identify
                            more appropriate player groups and note which combinations of these groups performed best together in five-player lineups. To further demonstrate how these clusters could help
                            in front office decision-making, we calculated a Comparison Index based on player relative value (FiveThirtyEight's RAPTOR metric) and salary situation compared with a certain
                            team's weakest link within their most used lineup. Further development on this end is being done, and a Shiny app is currently being created to support decision making for all 30 NBA teams.

                        <span class="port-desc desc2 desc-right" data-scroll>Sports bring out a lot of emotion from different people, and these emotions are captured in their rawest form in post-game interviews
                            and press conferences. Fresh off major wins and losses, players and coaches are subject to media questions and their feelings on the game and how it was played (among others) is put
                            into light. For this project, I analyzed post-game interviews from both players and coaches to see if there were any interesting patterns and differences between how a certain
                            player and a certain coach show emotion after a high-pressure game.<br><br>In this project, I analyzed the 9 NBA Finals series that LeBron James was a part of: 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014,
                            2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Within these series, I compared the sentiments of the interviews held with LeBron and each of his four coaches in those seasons: Mike Brown, Erik Spoelstra,
                            David Blatt, and Tyronn Lue. I gathered transcript logs from ASAP Sports performed text frequency analyses, sentiment analyses, and topic modeling to understand the effect of results, experience,
                            and opponent on a player's post-game interview.</span>

                            For companies, analyzing these reviews and understanding the sentiment and overarching/dominant topics discussed within these reviews could give insight on developments the company could
                         make to improve on its management and human resource initiatives. Seeing which aspects of an employee-employer relationship are most discussed when assessing a company's overall performance
                         could also help human resource managers and business unit leaders understand what's most important to their workforce and prioritize in terms of their management capabilities.<br><br> After
                         cleaning the review data for 4 different companies, text and sentiment analyses allowed me to see the overall performance and sentiment for each of the companies, identify which aspects of the employee life are most
                        important to these employees, and understand whether positive or negative aspects had a higher pull on a company's rating. Topic modeling also allowed me to provide the most talked about issues
                        and aspects of employee life and their effect on rating.</span>

                         relevant internal/external news around the company and industry). Here, public companies are able to share their financial performance with investors and explain any context
                        behind the results within the firm. Within this call, analysts, investors, and company officials are able to interact with each other to understand the current situation of

                        understand the relationship of these measures with investor/stockholder reception, and consequently, what investors find most important and drastic in assessing company value. This kind of analyses could also be applied
                            for companies not just in the sports and entertainment industries, but in many others that rely on public companies' relationship with investors and other stockholders.</span>

                        <span class="port-team team5 team-left" data-scroll>Advanced Statistical Inference &nbsp; | &nbsp; December 2019</span>
                        <span class="port-desc desc5 desc-left" data-scroll>Many of the NBA's most high-profile players have made their cases as the best, greatest, and most influential stars within their own generations and throughout its history. It's
                        sparked a conversation amongst fans as to who really is the greatest player to have graced the sports biggest stage. Three players whose names have most often come up
                            in many experts' and critics' lists are players that come from different generations and dominated all throughout their illustrious careers: <b><a class="desc-links" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a></b>, whose 20-year career displayed a level of longevity
                            and dominance on all levels of the sport that has still been unmatched; <b><a class="desc-links" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/jordami01.html">Michael Jordan</a></b>, whose undeniable competitiveness, all-around talent, and winning mentality led to being the most influential star in the game's
                            history; and <b><a class="desc-links" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/jamesle01.html">LeBron James</a></b>, whose sheer athleticism, drive to make those around him better, and incomparable I.Q. on both ends of the floor have catapulted him to a record-breaking level since entering the league out of high school.<br><br>
                        Using 5 statistics-based factors, I was able to use multiple models and methods (e.g. logistic regression, mixed models) to rank each of the three players' relative performances and answer some interesting questions along the way, such as:
                            who had the best production at each age, which teams each of the three performed the best against, and which round of the playoffs brought out the best from the three stars?<br><br> DISCLAIMER: Using statistics does not paint a complete picture
                            of a player's contribution to the sport, but does give a more grounded perspective on a more tangible aspect of the argument. Further studies can use more all-encompassing statistics, team statistics, and other intangible measures to provide a
                            clearer and well-rounded perspective on the study.

                        a familiar surface/feel of your home arena definitely helps player and team psychology and is demonstrated by trends (both positive and negative) in statistical performance. One basic statistic
                        that demonstrates a team's or player's performance on a nightly basis is shooting percentage. More often than not, teams/players perform better on their home floor. But, is there a way to go
                        deeper than that and see which cities and arenas are toughest for players to perform in?<br><br>Using Tableau to visualize comparisons between player and team performances at home and away can help NBA front
                        offices and coaching staffs to set their game plans around the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents and their own players, especially when going into games in tougher environments.
                            It also helps teams identify points of improvement for their lineups and players by seeing which have larger differences between shooting performances at home and away. Moving forward, this type of visualization
                        can help coaches easily understand and analyze trends in other stats and apply different parameters suited to their needs.</span>

                        digital advertising. By understanding [1] which revenue streams were most effective in raising the overall profit of the organization, [2] what projected sales were going to be for each revenue stream, [3] which customers and salespersons were most crucial to
                        the business, and [4] which digital products were most promising, Daily Media Blitz (a hypothetical media company) would be able to see which products and revenue streams it could prioritize in terms of effort and investment.<br><br>By visualizing many of these
                        factors, management would easily see the daily performance of the company, how various products and revenue streams are performing, and where to invest more money and resources. One other thing that our group tackled was the effectiveness of their discount and
